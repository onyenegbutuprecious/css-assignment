        <p>espite the fact that, as Shakespeare said, "the pen is mightier than the sword," the pen itself is not enough to make an effective writer. In fact, though we may all like to think of ourselves as the next Shakespeare, inspiration alone is not the key to effective essay writing. You see, the conventions of English essays are more formulaic than you might think – and, in many ways, it can be as simple as counting to five.

            Steps to Writing an Essay
            Follow these 7 steps for the best results:
            
            Read and understand the prompt: Know exactly what is being asked of you. It’s a good idea to dissect the prompt into parts.
            Plan: Brainstorming and organizing your ideas will make your life much easier when you go to write your essay. It’s a good idea to make a web of your ideas and supporting details.
            Use and cite sources: Do your research. Use quotes and paraphrase from your sources, but NEVER plagiarize.
            Write a Draft: Ernest Hemingway once said, “The first draft of anything is always crap.” While the truth behind this statement is debatable, drafts are always a good place to get any of your “crappy” ideas out of the way and are often required by professors and instructors.
            Make a strong thesis: The thesis (main argument) of the essay is the most important thing you’ll write. Make it a strong point.
            Respond to the prompt: Once you have worked out any kinks in your draft, you can start writing the final draft of your essay.
            Proofread: Read your response carefully to make sure that there are no mistakes and that you didn’t miss anything.
            Of course, every essay assignment is different and it’s important to be mindful of that. If one of these steps isn’t applicable to the essay you are writing, skip it and move to the next one.
            
            The Five Paragraph Essay
            Though more advanced academic papers are a category all their own, the basic high school or college essay has the following standardized, five paragraph structure:
            
            Paragraph 1: Introduction
            Paragraph 2: Body 1
            Paragraph 3: Body 2
            Paragraph 4: Body 3
            Paragraph 5: Conclusion
            
            Though it may seem formulaic – and, well, it is - the idea behind this structure is to make it easier for the reader to navigate the ideas put forth in an essay. You see, if your essay has the same structure as every other one, any reader should be able to quickly and easily find the information most relevant to them.
            
            The Introduction

            The principle purpose of the introduction is to present your position (this is also known as the "thesis" or "argument") on the issue at hand but effective introductory paragraphs are so much more than that. Before you even get to this thesis statement, for example, the essay should begin with a "hook" that grabs the reader’s attention and makes them want to read on. Examples of effective hooks include relevant quotations ("no man is an island") or surprising statistics ("three out of four doctors report that…").
            
            Only then, with the reader’s attention "hooked," should you move on to the thesis. The thesis should be a clear, one-sentence explanation of your position that leaves no doubt in the reader’s mind about which side you are on from the beginning of your essay.
            
            Following the thesis, you should provide a mini-outline which previews the examples you will use to support your thesis in the rest of the essay. Not only does this tell the reader what to expect in the paragraphs to come but it also gives them a clearer understanding of what the essay is about.</p>
